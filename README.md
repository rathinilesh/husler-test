I'll create a single HTML file that implements all three AI features (Smart Product Search, Dynamic Pricing Engine, and Recommendation System) while maintaining the basic product catalog functionality. The implementation will be clean, responsive, and user-friendly.
All Three AI Features Implemented:
  Smart Product Search (NLP)
  Dynamic Pricing Engine
  Recommendation System
  
  This AI-powered e-commerce system could integrate blockchain technology in several ways:
Token-Gated Pricing: Customers holding loyalty tokens could receive special AI-generated pricing.
On-Chain Preferences: User preferences could be stored on-chain to create immutable shopping profiles.
Smart Contract Loyalty: Purchase history could trigger automatic token rewards via smart contracts.
Decentralized Identity: Verified customer identities could enable hyper-personalized recommendations while preserving privacy.
